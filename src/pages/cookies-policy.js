                  A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer
                  or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to
                  remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font
                  size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you
                  don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the
                  site or browse from one page to another.
